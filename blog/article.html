                    <p> “I believe my most useful qualities in this role are patience and kindness.
                         In my role as a caregiver in a group home for the elderly, 
                         I was frequently the only attending caregiver on my floor overnight. 
                         I had one gentleman who would always buzz me to attend to him, 
                         but because he was experiencing memory loss and dementia, 
                         when I arrived he would forget he just buzzed me for the same thing. 
                         I always showed him kindness and patience, and as a result, he requested me as his caregiver when 
                        he left the group home to live with a family member. They hired me for in-home care.”
